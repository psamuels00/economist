# The Economist Print Covers - Examples

This directory contains sample output from a single execution of The Economist Printer Covers program.
It was generated using the "-r" option so that images are referenced from the source rather than the
local copies that were made when the program was run.  This allows the index pages to work from any
location, even if the images are not available locally.
